# Jacob Freedman's Open Source GIS Portfolio | [GEOG0323 - Open Source GIS](https://gis4dev.github.io/)
Hello, my name is Jacob Freedman and I am a student at Middlebury College. This website has been created for GEOG0323 - Open Source GISscience in Spring, 2021.
The course website is found [here](https://gis4dev.github.io).

## GIScience Analyses

1. [Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)

## Musings

1. [What is Open GIScience?](musings/open-source.md)
2. [Is GIS a Reproducible Science?](musings/gis-as-reproducible-science.md)

### Data Disclaimer
Maps have transformational power to reimagine our relationships to the land we are on, simultaneously influencing what the future of our world could look like. I recognize that the representations of space and time in these analyses represent one of many stories about the history of this place and the people who have called these places home. Generations of implicit and explicit erasure have been intended to shroud the origins of many of the data layers represented in these maps. As I strive to build a more equitable land conservation and GIS movement, I are committed to examining the data acquisition and visualization practices I have inherited and repairing our relationships to the people and places around us.
