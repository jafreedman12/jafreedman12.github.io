# Jacob Freedman's Open Source GIS Portfolio
Hello, I am Jacob Freedman and I am a student at Middlebury College participating in the Open Source GISscience.

## GIScience Analyses

1. [Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)
2. another future analysis

The course website is found [here](https://gis4dev.github.io).

Thanks so much! Have a great rest of your day!

_However_ remember that sometimes Github takes a few minutes, maybe ten whole minutes, to render changes to website.

## Musings

1. [What is Open GIScience?](musings/open-source.md)
2. another future blog
