# Jacob Freedman's Open Source GIS Portfolio | [GEOG0323 - Open Source GIS](https://gis4dev.github.io/)
Hello, my name is Jacob Freedman and I am a student at Middlebury College. This website has been created for GEOG0323 - Open Source GISscience in Spring, 2021.
The course website is found [here](https://gis4dev.github.io).

## GIScience Analyses

1. [Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)
2. [Replicating the Rosgen Classification System](https://github.com/jafreedman12/RE-rosgen/blob/main/docs/report/HEGSRR-Replication-Report.md)

## Musings

1. [What is Open GIScience?](musings/open-source.md)
2. [Is GIS a Reproducible Science?](musings/gis-as-reproducible-science.md)
3. [Error and Uncertainty in GIS](musings/error-and-uncertainty.md)

### More about me!

I am passionate about community engagement, inclusive mapping, spatial analysis, and youth empowerment. My background is in helping young people become changemakers for the future of their hometowns and local ecosystems. I design and share maps to help all people connect with places that they live, no matter where they live. I am passionate that community relationships can help us build a more effective conservation movement. 

- Connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-freedman-124b41201/)!
- Explore [Treeline Terrains](https://www.treelineterrains.com/), a business I helped to start that is selling 3D, wood-carved models of mountains and landscapes across the world. We use open source software and a CNC router to create our models, and are working to help all people connect to the land they are on, no matter their ability.
- Learn more about my work with the [Wild Hometown Movement](http://www.wildhometown.org/) and helping young people become leaders and changemakers for the future of local nature. In collaboration with the Academics for Land Protection in New England, we wrote a [toolkit](https://www.wildlandsandwoodlands.org/toolkit-for-student-leaders) to support young leaders to take action in their own hometowns. 
- My senior thesis is about inclusive mapmaking and how we can bridge critical, cartographic theory into the nonprofit conservation world. Stay tuned for more updates!

### Land Acknowledgement
The analyses and research for this course are taking place on the lands of the Abenaki people, in what is now known as Middlebury, Vermont.

### Data Disclaimer
Maps have transformational power to reimagine our relationships to the land we are on, simultaneously influencing what the future of our world could look like. I recognize that the representations of space and time in these analyses represent one of many stories about the history of this place and the people who have called these places home. Generations of implicit and explicit erasure have been intended to shroud the origins of many of the data layers represented in these maps. As I strive to build a more equitable land conservation and GIS movement, I are committed to examining the data acquisition and visualization practices I have inherited and repairing our relationships to the people and places around us.
