title: Is GIS a Reproducible Science?

## Which category of “GIS Use” most applies to the work you have done so far in this course or other courses using GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as “science”?

There are three main camps of thinking around the purpose/use of GIS --thinking of GIS as a tool, as toolmaking, and as a science. For those who believe that GIS is a tool, there is a general understanding the GIS is used to help achieve scientific aims but is not itself the scientific *end*. In this light, GIS is used to achieve the scientific aims of the discipline of geography (Halls 1993; Wright et al. 1997). On the other end of the spectrum, those who believe that GIS is a science equate its development within the geographic and computer science disciplines as a process of creating and formalizing geospatial techniques in a computer-automated platform (Bartlett 1993b). If science is an approach to test hypotheses and identify logical answers, this means there needs to be some theory to back up the ways in which experiments are conducted. 

In my classes at Middlebury, I think that we have most often used GIS as a tool and for toolmaking, with less emphasis on the idea of GIS as a science. While my introduction into GIS certainly focused on the principles and the "how" of how GIS functions, the emphasis/end point for the class is always using GIS to solve challenges present in society. Through my Senior Thesis, I have certainly thought more about GIS as a science, particulary around critical GIS and ethical uses of GIS in the (re)presentation of nature and conserved areas. As I have advanced through my time at Middlebury, I have been able to explore GIS through a variety of lenses, while noticing that some of my peers have taken very different

## How can open source GIS contribute to solving problems of the reproducibility crisis?



On Monday, March 8, we will debate:

Whether GIS should be considered a science?
If/how open source GIS can help with the crisis of reproducibility and replicability in science?

In preparation for/response to the debate, please prepare a reflection/position statement on the two questions in the form of a blog-style post on your GitHub site. Specifically, you might reflect on:
