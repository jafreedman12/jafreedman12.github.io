title: Uncertainty in Humanitarian GIS
date: Friday, April 30th, 2021

Consider the Craford & Finn (2014) article and any of the crowd-sourced / volunteered geographic information (VGI) you have already worked with personally (e.g. Twitter, OpenStreetMap) in relation to Longley et al’s framework of uncertainty filters in the process of geograaphic research.

- What types of uncertainty are most prevalant in the use of VGI for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
- Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
- Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?
