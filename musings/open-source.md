title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

This is a reflection on readings regarding Open Source GIScience for Monday, March 1st.

Open Source GIScience is comprised of two primary components -- free software and free code editing/writing capabilities. Whereas free software has no monetary cost and lets anyone around download and use the program, the free software *movement* theoretically permits anyone to modify, enhance, and release new code. Free, outward-facing software (such as QGIS) is  developed through open-source coding projects to which anyone can contribute. However, there are some cases where free software (such as Google Earth Engine) are not open source for users to write their own software tools. Certainly, there are opportunities to share code repositories and tools, but this does not constitute open-source software where users are constantly updating and developing the program -- at the end of the day, the centralized power of Google is still in charge of which tools are included in the program.

The web and desktop applications for Github are some of the primary tools for documentation of open-source software development. In essence, Git is a  collaboration platform that allows code developers to simultaneously create and edit workflows.

As explored by Rey (2009) and Singleton et al. (2016), academia stands to benefit greatly from the advent of open source software and the congruent software development movement. While academics often use spatial analysis tools to advance their research, there are fewer scenarios where researchers design their own GIS tools to complete their research goals. On the other hand, the development of open GIScience software is often completed in the private sector. Open source coding products, such as R and spdep, can help academics move away from GUI-based software and create more reproducible research. This intersection of  academic and "private-sector" use of Open GIScience can lead to more transparency and accountability in spatial analysis, potentially supporting a new generation 

Github allows developers to create their own webpages and provides open access to the information "behind the curtain" about how the website has been created. I believe that our classroom learning can go hand-in-hand with the principles of Open GIScience, albeit with some modifactions to how we observe the honor code with one another. Considering that Open GIScience encourages collaboration, it could be fascinating to work in small groups throughout the semester to develop publically-available tools, all while regularly creating blog posts documenting our individual contributions. Open GIScience has an incredibly important role in academia, encouraging collaboration between students to solve real-world problems by inventing solutions that have never been created before. I would struggle to think of a challenge that is better suited for students studying spatial analysis at a liberal arts college. While I recognize that much of this course is structured around independently editing shared problems, the open-access nature could make it challenging to keep students accountable to the Honor Code. I believe that all students will oblige with the honor code, but to maintain accountability, we would benefit from writing explicit guidelines and strategies, as agreed to by course participants.  

While there may be concerns of accountability and documentation within open-source software development, I believe that openly-accessible and reproducible code can 

Certainly, the collaborative nature of open-source software and lack of centralized authority is an affront traditional, Western forms of project management. When we look at collaborative communities and initiatives around the world 

Perhaps the greatest risk within open-source software development is the high barrier-to-entry for folks unversed in coding and spatial analysis development. Even for myself, a frequent user of GUI-based GIS platforms, I feel mildly intimidated in writing my own code for geographic analyses. I believe that free GUI-based software, such as QGIS, are essential in bridging the divide between 

Similarly, creating platforms upon which 


QUESTIONS
In what way might something be open source but not free?
How is free as in the free software movement different from free as in a cost of $0.00?

Is there space for Open GIScience in an undergraduate liberal arts education?

What risks/benefits do you see for use of open source GIS in science?
… and in government?
… and in private businesses?

As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for learning, the honor code, and evaluation/grades?
What are the meanings of free software, open source, and open science?


The main organization for open source GIS is [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)
