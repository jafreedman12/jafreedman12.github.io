title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

This is a reflection on readings regarding Open Source GIScience for Monday, March 1st.

The main organization for open source GIS is [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)
The web and desktop applications for Github are the primary tools for documentation of open-source software development. In essence, Git is a  collaboration platform that allows code developers to simultaneously create and edit workflows.

Open Source GIScience is comprised of two primary components -- free software and free code editing/writing capabilities. Whereas free software has no monetary cost and lets anyone around download and use the program, the free software *movement* theoretically permits anyone to modify, enhance, and release new code. Free, outward-facing software (such as QGIS) is  developed through open-source coding projects that anyone can contribute to. 

Github allows developers to create their own webpages and provides open access to the information "behind the curtain" about how the website has been created. 


I believe that our classroom learning can go hand-in-hand with the principles of Open GIScience, albeit with some modifactions to how we observe the honor code with one another. Considering that Open GIScience encourages collaboration, it could be fascinating to work in small groups throughout the semester to develop publically-available tools, all while regularly creating blog posts documenting our individual contributions.

While I recognize that much of this course is structured around independently editing shared problems, the open-access nature could make it challenging to keep students accountable to the Honor Code. While I want to believe that all students will oblige with the honor code (and I do believe this), we need explicit guidelines and strategies, as agreed by course participants, to hold one another accountable.  

While there may be concerns of accountability and documentation within open-source software development, I believe that openly-accessible and reproducible code can  

QUESTIONS
As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for learning, the honor code, and evaluation/grades?
What are the meanings of free software, open source, and open science?

In what way might something be open source but not free?

How is free as in the free software movement different from free as in a cost of $0.00?

Is there space for Open GIScience in an undergraduate liberal arts education?

What risks/benefits do you see for use of open source GIS in science?
… and in government?
… and in private businesses?
