1. Summarize the analytical techniques applied and how the results of those techniques were communicated in text, numbers, tables, or data visualizations

This analysis was done to assess the spatial patterns of wildfire awareness around San Diego during the wildfires of May, 2014. By filterning tweets for text where "fire" and "wildfire" are included, followed by a more specific filterning of tweets with geographic locations (Bernardo and San Marcos) and coordinate data, these data were used to spatially and temporally analyze wildfire-centered Twitter posts. The spatial patterning of tweets was expressed through a map of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) (Dual KDE = Cell value of tweets / Cell value of population --> proportional number of tweet in each pixel) of wildfire tweet density. The temporal distribtuon of tweets about fire/wildfire, along with fires in Bernardo and San Marcos, were expressed through bar charts of tweet frequencies by day. The most frequent conservation topics were determined by a k-means clustering of conversation topics, illuminating the general themes that people were discussiong on Twitter. Lastly, the spatial patterns of interconnectivity were explored by how frequently one's tweets were re-tweeted (or how often users retweeted others) through charts and maps illustrating network connectivity of news outlets and government officials. In conclusion, this study finds that the highest of tweets come from impact area and 
 
- a few users are retweeted often, most people are never retweeted or never retweet

- what's the deal with fig. 6 map?? population normalized to 1000 ppl?


2. Consder whether you consider this research paper to be reproducibile and whether you consider this paper to be replicable. Refer to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine definitions of reproducibility and replicability and our prior discussions about GIS as a Science.

I think this analysis by Wang et al. (2016) is both reproducible in the context of wildfires in San Diego and replicable to analysis of natural disasters occuring in other time frames and landscapes 

- reproduce: re-create the same study using the same data and methods
- replicate: use theories and practices from one study in a new context, and arrive at same (or similar) results.
