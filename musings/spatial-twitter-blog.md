1. Summarize the analytical techniques applied and how the results of those techniques were communicated in text, numbers, tables, or data visualizations

- filter for text where "fire" and "wildfire" are seen
- filter for text with geographic locations
- filter for tweets with geolocation (coordinate data)
- use tweets and retweets to analyze
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for spatial patterning of tweets, text mining for conversartion topics, netwokr analysis to determine interconnectivity to thought leaders
- Dual KDE = Cell value of tweets / Cell value of population --> proportional number of tweet in each pixel
- kmeans clustering of conversation topics


2. Consder whether you consider this research paper to be reproducibile and whether you consider this paper to be replicable. Refer to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine definitions of reproducibility and replicability and our prior discussions about GIS as a Science.

- reproduce: re-create the same study using the same data and methods
- replicate: use theories and practices from one study in a new context, and arrive at same (or similar) results.
