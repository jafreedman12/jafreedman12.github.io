I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:

Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
What responsibilties do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?
What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?
